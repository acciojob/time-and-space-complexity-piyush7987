	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to describe how the runtime of an algorithm increases its efficient as the size of the input grows. It helps us estimate how fast or slow a program or function will run, especially when dealing with large data sets.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses while running, relative to the size of the input. It includes the memory used by variables, data structures, function calls, and any temporary storage required during execution. Space complexity is usually expressed using Big O notation, such as O(1) for constant space or O(n) for linear space. Understanding space complexity is important when working with limited memory or optimizing applications for performance and scalability.
